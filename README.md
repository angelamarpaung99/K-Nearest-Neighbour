# K-Nearest-Neighbour
Preprocessing includes imputing missing values.
Analyze Data with plotting box plot to find outliers and Correlation Matrix. 

Count Accuracy with Accuracy count and K-Fold Cross Validation.
Accuracy obtained is 75% and K-Fold Cross Validation mean result obtained is 83.33%

Test set is then visualized with scatter plot.

Dataset can be found in "dataset.csv" and data train can be found in "Data Train.csv".
